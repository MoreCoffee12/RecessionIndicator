# Recession Indicator
For one of my machine learning classes we had a project that consumed financial data. I have extended that project to use machine learning to see if an indicator, or predictor, can be found that identifies market tops that occur prior to recessions. Then I use the model to build a trading strategy and backtest it to see how it performs.

## Installation
The project is written in R Markdown so just download the .rmd file and build using knitr.
